    "*Since I was young, I love math. After finishing my medical school, during my postgrad in economics, I got a chance to learn math and econometrics. At that time, I was not aware of myself that I like statistics as I had not enough time to catch up the essence of econometrics. More than two years later when I was in public health field, I got a chance to learn biostatistics from scratch in my postgrad in Public Health and I have found myself. More than three years later, in 2022, I heard about data science and I am curious to know what it is. In the end of 2022, I decided to learn Data Science to pursue a career as a public health data scientist.*  "
